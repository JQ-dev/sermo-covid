I didn't ""panic buy"" these things because I was working.  Now, Clorox wipes and toilet paper are getting price gouged at $25-50/roll on eBay!?  I understand the laws of supply and demand, but we wouldn't price gouge a patient in their time of need.

The number of cases is irrelevant, it's a side statistic to just keep track of and tally at the end. It will never go down regardless of what the ""curve"" is doing, and it will only serve to scare people. The important statistic is incidence, *new cases per unit time, then presenting that data adjusted for ""new"" cases that are likely simply the result of increased testing. Epidemiologists come on as ""correspondents"" on the talk show news, but they need to educate the networks on this. My dad/old man literally watching MSNBC and CNN all day...all...f'ing...day. At least they present facts, unlike Fox, but they need to be educated on which facts/stats are pertinent for tracking contagion progression and behavior, and which are not really that pertinent. I'm actually shocked given that the networks keep blathering ad nauseam about ""blunting the curve,"" and as many brilliant scientists are out there, that no epidemiologists, biostatisticians, or MD/MPH's have made this known to the news networks yet. Even I know this simply from basic medical school education from our scant coverage of stats/epidemiology in the medical decision-making curriculum.",,,,"us1"

I don't touch anyone until that's all done. Wash my hands a lot.  Wipe down with disinfectant wipes anything I purchase and bring into the house.  I keep hand sanitizer, disinfectant wipes and spray in the house, and use it liberally.","2","2","1","2","None of the statistics presented to us have denominators. If there are 1500 confirmed cases: 1500 out of what? How many people were tested?  How many people are sick?  Out of a specific population?  How many people tested came out NEGATIVE?  How many people got the disease and now are fine?  Yes, there are a huge number of cases, but the more you test, the more positives you'll find. This inflates the number of the sick in states that test, and makes it look like there are states that have few cases, just because they aren't testing.  This is bad use of statistics, and very anxiety producing for patients.",,,,"us1"

Difficult to balance the protection measures against virus spread vs economic impact in the whole society. Measures have to be taken based on previous experiences and daily information. But experiences in other countries not always reflect the reality for the new comers, and information is not completely trustable due to the lack of testing. In one hand we have the chaotic situation inside hospitals and ICUs, with health personnel exposed to a death risk without proper protection. On the other, the great majority of the population healthy and inside a safe environment looking ahead and worried about their future. Nobody is wrong. It is a matter or perspective. As a health care provider, my view is - first let’s save as many lives as we can, lowering the curve and offering the possibility of being treated for all the severe cases. Observe how society and infection dissemination evolves. Program to reduce limitations as quickly as possible, starting with lower risk groups. Observe if there is a second hit. Release more groups. Let the economy move. Observe. Release more. Second wave will come when children start to go to school, they will get mild infection but will bring it home and we will see numbers rise again. While all this happen, as a doctor, we will still have to support our patients, our families and our medical societies, trying to guess what is the best next step. Not easy, but we cannot stop.","3","6","6","non_us1"
